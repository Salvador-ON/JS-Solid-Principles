/* This principle states that if we have a parent class and a child class, then we can interchange the parent and child class without getting incorrect results.
This means that the child class must implement everything thatâ€™s in the parent class. The parent class serves the class has the base members that child classes extend from.
For example, if we want to implement classes for a bunch of shapes, we can have a parent Shape class, which are extended by all classes by implementing everything in the Shape class. */
